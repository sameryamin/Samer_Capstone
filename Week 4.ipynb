One of the most famous aspects of that cirt is the food they have. Therefore, many entrepreneurs are attracted to the city and try to open resteraunts in many different locations accross the city. This project will focus on the problem of unsuccessful resteraunts and the reasons they could have been unsuccessful. The audience of this project will mainly be entrepreneurs.\n\n\n## 2. Problem\n\nOpening a resteraunt in Amman city is extremely challenging as research shows that a very high percentage of people that open resteraunts in that city fail to be successful. It is believed that the reason for this is that the resteraunts were opened in the wrong areas and attracted the wrong group of customers. The location of opening was shown to be one of the most important aspects of opening a resteraunt in that city. Fo that reason, the main objective of this project is to suggest and recommend, to future entrepreneurs planning on opening a resteraunt in that city, the best choices of location so that they can largely increase their chances of success. These recommendations will be proven with data from the data science team. This problem is extremely important to resolve as many entrepreneurs with potential are going bankrupt.\n\n## 3. Data Sources\n\nThe data this project will utilize will mainly be sources from the following locations:\n\nFoursquare API\nGoogle maps\nGeospatial data for Amman's neighborhoods\nPopulation by FSA\n\n## 4. Data description\n\nAll the data stated above will be ustilized to solve this problem and try to find the best location to open a resteraunt in a certain neighborhood. Before deciding on what aspects of the data will be considered, first we need to consider what type of resteraunt we are opening. From there, we can use the data sources to filter out certain groups and their locations to figure out and find the most appropriate location.\n\n## 5. Methodology\n\nThe methodology section will consist of the methods used to complete this project. There were 4 methods utilized to complete this project:\n1. Collect and organise the data to be analysed\n2. Understand the data collected\n3. prepare and process the data\n4. Model the data\n\n## 6. Results and Discussion\n\nFirstly, even though the city to be considered here is not very technological in comparison to the other cities we worked with earlier, alot of data can still be gathered on the locations and neighborhood that the future business men could utilize and explore. We will discuss the results in mainly 2 ways. First we will filter and sort them out according to which neighborhoods they came from and what they really represent. It is very interseting to showcase that even though the north of the city contains more than 90% of the \"upper class\" individuals, it is still not the best place to open a resteraunt in Amman. Results show that there are many different neighborhood emerging as the 'future' of Amman and could be the best places to start and open a resteraunt to arrtract many customers. Second, we may consider and alayse our results using the 5 clusters we contructed earlier. Even though all of them will prioritize individuals in neighborhoods according to how many they are, there could be an optimum balance or pattern that we could find in the results. For example there could be different resteraunts that target different things. For intance, one might want to open a resteraunt and sell for very expensive prices such that they attract very rich people. Another might want to open a restaraunt for the 'lower class' such that they could get an extremely large number of customers and rely on bulk sales instead of single high-price sales.\n\n\n## 7. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, to solve this problem, one must go through a detailed systematic approach using data. In my opinion, at this stage, people should not have a problem like this one as they gave all the tools and technology to crack it. In the scenario, it is extremely important to utilize all the data we have and use data science and possibly machine learning to provise businessmen and people with better oppurtunities and therefore make our community a more prosperous place with more and more oppurtunities.\n"
